####The Future's simple - and without any road "blocks".

Simple library to demonstrate 'non-blocking' future's in Java. No need of Future.get() anymore - instead rely on dynamic notification for completion/cancellation/failure

Demonstrates the techniques by which fancy Future abstractions are provided by various JVM languages / frameworks

NOTE: Java 8 includes the CompletableFuture class which is a huge step forward, and may be worth a look.
